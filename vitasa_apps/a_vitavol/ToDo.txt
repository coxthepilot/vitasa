Staff website
>> website to do list is in WebStorm


.org Website
* update sites page to use an accordion
* need to put the privacy policy at vitasa.org/en/privacy-policy.html
* website map to use get all sites from backend (or cached version)
- way to ask for sites today, or tomorrow



Improvements:
* SC vol hours: delete failed: still removed from list and no error shown [cannot fix; will require further research and effort]
    - remove from listview happens in listview helper before the delete callback is called
* for SC in adding hours, put users that frequent that site at the top in a section
* for vol, put their frequent sites at the top in a section
* move geocode to the save activity; handle multiple responses and hide lat/long in view?
* sitedetails: for client, show closed now, next opens at xxx on yyy
* use notifications as way to know site has changed rather than timeouts
