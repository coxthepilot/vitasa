* GV helper
   - use callbacks for each grid element
   - light (dark?) grey behind day of week name
   - background as standard background color (not graphic)
   - new symbols graphics?
* move geocode to the save activity; handle multiple responses and hide lat/long in view?
* (Android) create an activity indicator in a fragment?
