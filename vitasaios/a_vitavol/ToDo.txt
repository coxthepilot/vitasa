Issues:
* don't believe calendar signups' are working
* fix the gitignore
* retries on all api gets? should only retry on the specific error type; C_SiteSchedule for WebException
* need Season in API /get/site
* on notification, the graphic is a tiny slice from the middle [later]

Future
* no way for a volunteer to view past signups?
* need option to include work intents on user and site; separate control for each past and future

Complete but verification needed
* riverwalk background not showing up on device [done, previous image was too large]
* openning image is distorted [done]
* didn't allow a second signup on a date [done]
* Add new signup to local calendar [done, need to register a calendar?]
* use grey on open screen register and about buttons [done]
* view signup, open/close time were empty string [done]
* save hours button, grey out, 'save hours' [wnf]
* new signup, don't know there is no one else signed up [done]

Check:
* all Console.WriteLine are surrounded by #if DEBUG
* no un-caught exceptions
