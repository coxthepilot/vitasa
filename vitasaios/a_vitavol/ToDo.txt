----- Issues -----

Fixes:

Future features:
* use new graphics for UI
* allow more than 1 site coordinator and a backup
* create a site feature for in-person tax prep
* allow volunteer to select all shifts at a site
* allow advanced to signup for basic slots
* allow update email in profile
* no way for a volunteer to view past signups?
* need option to include work intents on user and site, or not; separate control for each past and future
* use notifications as way to know content has changed rather than timeouts
* sort sites based on distance to user

Shared Models:
* make sure models don't crash on bad data (such as nulls on date...)


Android:
<<<<<<< HEAD
* [android] allow user to change password on profile page
=======
* need to make the adv/basic signup more robust; fixed it on iOS after I did the Android release
* on notification, the graphic is a tiny slice from the middle of the icon [defer]

>>>>>>> origin/master

iOS: 
>> note: some changes made but not yet released through Apple
* [ios] allow user to change password on profile page

online:
* allow user to change password on profile page
* create admin UI similar to iPad

vitaadmin:
* update to user email, phone, password? don't stick
* show grid calendar for site calendar
* hours summary (with export)
* tool to set basic/adv number on shift
