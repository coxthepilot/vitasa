For Sheila/Alejandra
    Role for backup site coordinators? same powers as primary? Yes, backup operates just as primary
    iPhone only ok for volunteers and site coordinators? not planning Android for the vol/SC app...; no, need andriod
    Approval for vol hours and reporting; vol need way to set hours work, cant change after approved by SC; SC can always change
    Time to review the app? Fri 10am GCC
    Web design and DNS access

For Chris
* Protocol version; do I need to signal the API version I'm using? [post a github issue]
* >> Need api to register a push API token (string) along with user type (vol/sc vs client); for APNS
* >> Need GET/users/{id} to include the sites for which the user is a site coordinator?
* >> Need a fast(er) way to get slug to site name table 
* >> Need a fast(er) to get user id to name table
* Registrations of an email address already in the system generates a 'system error' [change error message]; error 422 [model validation failed]; expected? Post as an issue
* URL for production and staging

* [defered] client notification, would need a certificate on both ends [have cnn apps that do this]

Alejandra:
* Contact in IT for DNS cname and web update [in progress]
* Have her register then make her admin
* Web site design - do the mobile fix first

Issues:
* Chris: Drop-off to DropOff [done]
* Really should just store an id for sites, users, and work items in the serialized version
* Make another pass at the icon(s); use the VITA graphic
* Need DNS redirect

* (sc) needs way to manage the services available at the site(s) [complete after backend support]
* (client) Need flag on sites for virtual, express, and MFT [done until supported by the backend]
