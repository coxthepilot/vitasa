To Do:
    System Notifications (poll or APN)
    Entitlements
    Put size handles on all UI elements (!!! sigh !!!)
    Protocol version
    Hande lost password

Future
* Means to edit/change the Site season (from Back Office web UI)

For Sheila/Alejandra
    If SC, but no sites, treat as a volunteer? Or SC with no sites?
    Can backup SC's do everything the primary can? Yes...

For Chris
* Some very slow responses; probably network related; any way to view his response times?
* Occasionally getting a 422 on Registration; do logs show anything?
* 422 seems to be a DB error (like duplicate key)
* Some calls just return {true} as a bool; expected? Example: update site calendar
* Protocol version; do I need to signal the API version I'm using?

Bugs
* Register: occasional 422; when it starts, have to exit and come back in; after 2 registrations; could be db errors...
* Some login, other api responses VERY slow (could be my home wifi and internet)

Verify
* Local notifications are working
