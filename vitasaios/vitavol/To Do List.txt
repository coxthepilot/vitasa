To Do:
    System Notifications (poll or APN)
    Entitlements/Certificates
    Protocol version
    Hande lost password

Testing
* validate layout on iPhone 5s, 6, 6+, 7, 7+
* validate background fetch (every ~ 4 hours)

Future
* Means to edit/change the Site season (from Back Office web UI)

For Sheila/Alejandra
    If SC, but no sites, treat as a volunteer? Or SC with no sites?
    Role for backup site coordinators? same powers as primary?
    iPhone only ok for volunteers and site coordinators? not planning Android...

For Chris
* Some very slow responses; probably network related; any way to view his response times?
* Occasionally getting a 422 on Registration; do logs show anything?
* Some calls just return {true} as a bool; expected? Example: update site calendar
* Protocol version; do I need to signal the API version I'm using?
* >> Need api to register a push API token (string) along with user type (vol/sc vs client); for APNS
* >> Need GET/users/{id} to include the sites for which the user is a site coordinator?
* >> Need a fast(er) way to get slug to site name table 
* >> Need a fast(er) to get user id to name table
* FYI: must have a slash before ? Unpredictable results

Bugs
* Save Volunteer hours didn't start the spinner and left them dirty (<Back say them dirty)
* Looks like hours are all showing up approved
* Allow SC to change approved hours
* Color status images have white around them; make transparent or same as our background color 240/240/240
* Find signup for current user, don't do if site coordinator

Todo:
* get binary files off of github
* Need final words for the about page
