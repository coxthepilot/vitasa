To Do:
    System Notifications (poll or APN)
    Entitlements/Certificates
    Protocol version
    Hande lost password

Testing
* validate layout on iPhone 5s, 6, 6+, 7, 7+
* validate background fetch (every ~ 4 hours)

Future (near)
* Means to edit/change the Site season (from Back Office web UI)
* Need UI to CRUD all details about a user
* Need UI to CRUD all details on a site
* Need UI to CRUD all WorkItems (all users, all sites, all days - and select accordingly)
* Need admin and committee UI to CRUD all suggestions

For Sheila/Alejandra
    Role for backup site coordinators? same powers as primary? Yes, backup operates just as primary
    iPhone only ok for volunteers and site coordinators? not planning Android for the vol/SC app...; no, need andriod
    Approval for vol hours and reporting; vol need way to set hours work, cant change after approved by SC; SC can always change
    Time to review the app? Fri 10am GCC
    Web design and DNS access

For Chris
* Some calls just return {true} as a bool; expected? Example: update site calendar [tell him what we need]
* Protocol version; do I need to signal the API version I'm using? [post a github issue]
* >> Need api to register a push API token (string) along with user type (vol/sc vs client); for APNS
* >> Need GET/users/{id} to include the sites for which the user is a site coordinator?
* >> Need a fast(er) way to get slug to site name table 
* >> Need a fast(er) to get user id to name table
* Registrations of an email address already in the system generates a 'system error' [change error message]; error 422 [model validation failed]; expected? Post as an issue
* URL for production and staging
* client notification, would need a certificate on both ends

Bugs
* Make another pass at the icon(s)
* Streamlined github contents
* Need DNS redirect
