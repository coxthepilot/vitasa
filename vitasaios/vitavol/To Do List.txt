VC_Suggestion
    Add new suggestion, gets 422; unprocessable; probably schema issue
    Use a Multiline text box for the suggestion body

For Sheila/Alejandra
    If SC, but no sites, treat as a volunteer? Or SC with no sites?

For Chris
    *** Fixed: DELETE on /sites/slug/calendars/{id} gets error 400, bad request; don't send with a payload; the delete is being successful

    POST on /suggestions (create new suggestion) gets 422; stuck in VC_Suggestion on Save; fields null
       on return; >>> upload the code to github; done

    Getting 422 on POST intent; /signups not /users/6/signups

    Need UserId on WorkIntent; userid is there, look at response

    Need get user name (minimum) without Admin (or, eash SC gets admin?)
